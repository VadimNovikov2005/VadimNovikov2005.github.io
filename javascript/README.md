# javascript urdf-loader

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/urdf-loader.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/urdf-loader)

Utilities for loading URDF files into THREE.js and a Web Component that loads and renders the model.

[Demo here!](https://gkjohnson.github.io/urdf-loaders/javascript/example/index.bundle.html)

![Example](/javascript/docs/javascript-example.gif)

## URDFLoader
```html
<script src=".../URDFLoader.js"></script>
<script>
  const manager = new THREE.LoadingManager();
  const loader = new URDFLoader(manager);
  loader.load(
    '.../package/dir/',           // The equivelant of a (list of) ROS package(s):// directory
    'T12/urdf/T12.URDF',          // The path to the URDF within the package OR absolute
    robot => { },                 // The robot is loaded!
    (path, ext, done) => { },     // Callback for each mesh for custom mesh processing and loading code
   );
</script>
```

### Limitations
- Only `prismatic`, `continuous`, `revolute`, and `fixed` joints are supported.
- Collision tags are not parsed.

### API
#### URDFLoader(manager)

Constructor

##### manager

THREE.LoadingManager. Used for transforming load URLs.

#### URDFLoader.load(package, urdfpath, robotsCallback, geometryLoader, fetchOptions)

Loads and builds the specified URDF robot in THREE.js

##### package

_required_

The path representing the `package://` directory(s) to load `package://` relative files.

If the argument is a string, then it is used to replace the `package://` prefix when loading geometry. To specify multiple packages an object syntax used defining the package name to the package path:
```js
{
  "package1": ".../path/to/package1",
  "package2": ".../path/to/package2",
  ...
}
```

##### urdf

_required_

The path to the URDF file relative to the specified package directory.

##### robotCallback(robot)

_required_

Callback that is called once the urdf robots have been loaded. The loaded robot is passed to the function.

The available joints are specified on `robot.urdf.joints`.

To set a joint angle, call `robot.urdf.joint.setAngle(angle)`.

##### geometryLoader(pathToModel, fileExtension, doneCallback)

_optional_

An optional function that can be used to override the default mesh loading functionality. The default loader is specified at `URDFLoader.defaultMeshLoader`. `doneCallback` is called with the mesh once the geometry has been loaded.

##### fetchOptions

_optional_

An optional object with the set of options to pass to the `fetch` function call used to load the URDF file.

## urdf-viewer Element
```html
<!-- Register the Element -->
<script href=".../urdf-viewer-element.js" />
<script>customElements.define('urdf-viewer', URDFViewer)</script>

<body>
  <urdf-viewer package=".../package/dir/" urdf="T12/urdf/T12.URDF" up="Z+" display-shadow ambient-color="red"></urdf-viewer>
</body>
```

### Attributes

#### package

Corresponds to the `package` parameter in `URDFLoader.load`. Supported are:

1. Single package:

    ```html
    // 1. Example for single package named `default_package`
    <urdf-viewer package=".../path/to/default_package" ...></urdf-viewer>
    ```

    Fallback within 1: If the target package within the `package://` relative files do not match the default path it is assumed that the default path is the parent folder that contains the target package(s).

    ```html
    // 1. Example for single package named `default_package` with fallback:
    <urdf-viewer package=".../path/to/parent" ...></urdf-viewer>
    // since `parent` does not match `default_package`
    // the path ".../path/to/parent/default_package" is assumed
    ```

2. Serialized package map:

    E.g. if the meshes of a URDF are distributed over mutliple packages.

    ```html
    // 2. Example for serialized package map that contains `package1` and `package2`
    <urdf-viewer package="package1:.../path/to/package1, package2:.../path/to/package1" ...></urdf-viewer>
    ```



#### urdf

Corresponds to the `urdfpath` parameter in `URDFLoader.load`.

The element uses fetch options `{ mode: 'cors', credentials: 'same-origin' }` to load the urdf file.

#### ignore-limits

Whether or not hte display should ignore the joint limits specified in the model when updating angles.

#### up

The axis to associate with "up" in THREE.js. Values can be [+-][XYZ].

#### display-shadow

Whether or not the render the shadow under the robot.

#### ambient-color

The color of the ambient light specified with css colors.

#### auto-redraw

Automatically redraw the model every frame instead of waiting to be dirtied.

### Properties

All of the above attributes have corresponding camel case properties.

#### angles

Sets or gets the angles of the robot as a dictionary of `joint-name` to `radian` pairs.

### Functions

#### setAngle(jointName, angle)

Sets the given joint to the provided angle in radians.

#### setAngles(jointDictionary)

Sets all joint names specified as keys to radian angle value.

#### redraw()

Dirty the renderer so the element will redraw next frame.

### Events

#### 'urdf-change'

Fires when the URDF has changed and a new one is starting to load.

#### 'ignore-limits-change'

Fires when the `ignore-limits` attribute changes.

#### 'urdf-processed'

Fires when the URDF has finished loading and getting processed.

#### 'geometry-loaded'

Fires when all the geometry has been fully loaded.
